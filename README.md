The software tool TFfinder has been designed to detect temporary field code smells.
It is using the proposed method mentioned in the reasearch paper " Gupta, Ruchin, and Sandeep Kumar Singh. "A Novel Metric based Detection of Temporary Field Code Smell and its Empirical Analysis." Journal of King Saud University-Computer and Information Sciences (2021)."
The detailed implementation details are avialable in reasearch paper "Gupta, Ruchin, and Sandeep Kumar Singh. "TFfinder: A Software tool to discover Temporary Field code smell." 2020 2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication Control and Networking (ICACCCN). IEEE, 2020."
Please don't forget to cite the above two papers while using the tool.
